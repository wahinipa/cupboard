# User Manual
## People
People have user accounts.
Most people have just one account.
Some people will have an extra administrative account.
(The reason for having an extra account might be to avoid accidentally misusing some super power 
before that first cup of coffee kicks in and your neurons start firing properly.)
### The Super-User: admin
There is a super-user account with the login of "admin".
This account has the power to do or change everything (including totally mangling the whole system).

Use it:
 * Only when necessary (like first time setup).
 * Only when you understand the consequences.

Therefore:
 * **LOG OUT from admin as soon as you complete some necessary task**
 * Use your regular user account for everyday activity.

### Regular User Accounts
A regular user account allows a person to:
 * Log on to the system.
 * Stare at the mostly blank screen.
 * Log out.

To do anything useful or fun requires attaching various roles to the user account.
When attached, depending on the role, the user is then able to see things
and perhaps change things.

A role can be specific, applying only to a specific Group or Place.
Or a role can be universal, applying to every Group and Place.

### Observer Role
The observer role allows a person to see the inventory.
They can browse the inventory, or do searches, or generate reports.

### Agent Role
The agent role allows a person to change things.
They can add to, or subtract from, the quantity of something at a specific location.
They can transfer items from one location to another if they have the agent role in both places.

### Catalog Role
The catalog role allows a person to modify the hierarchy of Things.
They could decide that Shoes needs to be further subdivided into Regular, Sandals and Snow Boots.
This role is a bit of a superpower, so it should be used carefully 
because it will affect all groups and places.

## Places
A place has things.
If a person needs to locate a particular kind of thing, the most refined location is called a Place.
When setting up a system, the places can be very specific: Front Room, Back Room, Main Room Shelving.
Or it can be very general: Our Town, Other Town.

A Place gets a Name and a Description.
The name will appear on form pages and as dialog selection items.
So the name should be concise.
The Description of a Place is available to observers and can be used to hold
useful information like the street address or maybe a list of who might have the keys to
a storage unit.

### Groups
Places are clustered into Groups.
A Group of Places might have an organizational connection (all run by the Such and So Society)
or it might be geographical (North Ying, Southwest Yang). 
It might simply be convenient (Main Office, Warehouse)

## Things
Things are organized into a hierarchy.
Imagine you are shopping online.
You might start out by choosing Clothing, then Shoes, then Girl's Shoes and finally types and sizes.

### Categories and Choices
While hierarchy is convenient, it is restrictive also.
For example suppose Toys might need to be further refined by whether it is an indoor toy or an outdoor toy
but also what is the age appropriate safety classification.
Should it be split first into indoor/outdoor and then by age?
Or the other way around?

The solution is Categories and Choices.
A Category has a name plus various choices with that category.
The toy problem could by solved by adding two Categories to Toys: Indoor/Outdoor and Recommended Age.
The Indoor/Outdoor category would have two choices: indoor and outdoor.
The Recommended Age category would have multiple choices for different ages.
